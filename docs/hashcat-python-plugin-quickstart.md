# Hashcat Python Plugin Developer Guide

## Introduction

This guide walks you through building custom hash modes in **pure Python** using Hashcat v7's Python plugin from the new assimilation bridge. Whether you're experimenting with a new algorithm, supporting a proprietary format, hacking a prototype, or just writing hashing logic in a high-level language, this plugin interface makes it fast and easy.

No C required. No recompilation. Just write your logic in pure python code in `calc_hash()`.

You can use any python modules you want.

## Quick Start

Hashcat mode `73000` is preconfigured to load a generic Python plugin source file from `Python/generic_hash_mp.py`:

```
hashcat -m 73000 -b
```

You can edit the `Python/generic_hash_mp.py`, or override the plugin source file with:

```
hashcat -m 73000 --bridge-parameter1=my_hash.py hash.txt wordlist.txt ...
```

## Yescrypt in One Line

### Generate a Yescrypt Test Hash

```
echo password | mkpasswd -s -m yescrypt
```

Example output:

```
$y$j9T$uxVFACnNnGBakt9MLrpFf0$SmbSZAge5oa1BfHPBxYGq3mITgHeO/iG2Mdfgo93UN0
```

### Prepare Hash Line for Hashcat

```
$y$j9T$uxVFACnNnGBakt9MLrpFf0$SmbSZAge5oa1BfHPBxYGq3mITgHeO/iG2Mdfgo93UN0*$y$j9T$uxVFACnNnGBakt9MLrpFf0$
```

(Use the full hash before the `*`, and the salt portion after the `*`.)

### Plugin Code

Install the module:

```
pip install pyescrypt
```

Then in your plugin (either `generic_hash_mp.py` for -m 73000 or `generic_hash_sp.py` for -m 72000)

```python
from pyescrypt import Yescrypt,Mode

# Self-Test pair
ST_HASH = "$y$j9T$uxVFACnNnGBakt9MLrpFf0$SmbSZAge5oa1BfHPBxYGq3mITgHeO/iG2Mdfgo93UN0*$y$j9T$uxVFACnNnGBakt9MLrpFf0$"
ST_PASS = "password"

def calc_hash(password: bytes, salt: dict) -> str:
  return Yescrypt(n=4096, r=32, p=1, mode=Mode.MCF).digest(password=password, settings=hcshared.get_salt_buf(salt)).decode('utf8')
```

That's it - full Yescrypt support in Hashcat with a single line of code.

### Run

```
hashcat -m 73000 yescrypt.hash wordlist.txt
```

---

## Debugging Without Hashcat

You can run your plugin as a standalone script:

```
python3 generic_hash.py
```

It reads passwords from stdin and prints the result of `calc_hash()`:

```
echo "password" | python3 generic_hash_mp.py
```

Note that you probably want to inline the correct salt value, see the `main` section in the code.

## Windows and Linux/macOS

There are significant differences between Windows and Linux/macOS when embedding Python as done here. It's a complex issue, and we hope future Python developments toward a fully GIL-free mode will resolve it. For now, we must work around platform-specific behavior.

### On Windows

The `multiprocessing` module is not fully supported in this embedded setup. As a result, only one thread can run effectively. While the `threading` module does work, most cryptographic functions like `sha256()` block the GIL. CPU-intensive algorithms such as 10,000 iterations of `sha256()` will monopolize the GIL, making the program effectively single-threaded.

### On Linux/macOS

The `multiprocessing` module works correctly, enabling full CPU utilization through parallel worker processes.

### Free-threaded Python (3.13+)

Python 3.13 introduces optional GIL-free support. This allows multithreading to work even in embedded Python, both on Linux and Windows. Hashcat leverages this through two modes:

- `-m 72000`: Uses free-threaded Python (no multiprocessing)
- `-m 73000`: Uses GIL-bound Python with multiprocessing

Multiprocessing (73000) supports most modules and is generally better for real-world workloads, but it works only on Linux. Developers may use `-m 73000` on Linux for performance and `-m 72000` on Windows for development, provided their code does not rely on modules that require `cffi` because this as of now lacks support for running with Python free-treaded ABI.

---

## Python 3.13 Requirement

The `-m 72000` mode requires Python 3.13 due to its reliance on the new free-threading feature. This feature is not available in earlier versions.

### Why Python 3.13 Isn't Preinstalled

Several Linux distributions, including Ubuntu 24.04, do not ship with Python 3.13 because it was released after the distroâ€™s feature freeze. You will likely need to install it manually.

### Installing Python 3.13

**On Windows**: Use the official installer and ensure you check the "Install free-threaded" option - it's disabled by default.

**On Linux/macOS**: Use `pyenv`. It's the easiest way to install and manage Python versions:

```
pyenv install 3.13t
pyenv local 3.13t
```

This makes it easy to manage `pip` packages without global installs or virtual environments.
